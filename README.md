## Getting Started

You will first need to do NPM init -y to get started with downlaoding the dependencies. After which you will enter npm i mysql and npm i inquirer but verison 8 so it will load. After which you will go into your package.json and go under scripts to take somethings. Starting with having 'Start': "node server.js" so it will load the inquirer and have the actual prompts appear. But before you can do that you will need to run mySQl and source the schema and then exit and NPM run seed to get the data loaded. After that npm start and begin. Thanks!
